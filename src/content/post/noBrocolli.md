## Bro, You Don’t Need Chicken Breast and Broccoli Every Day

Following *Bigger Leaner Stronger* in India doesn’t mean eating like a videshi. You can get jacked with **dal, dahi, and anda**—if you know what you’re doing.

> “To build muscle, aim for about 2 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight daily.” — *Mike Matthews*

That means if you weigh 70 kg, you need around **140g of protein**. Sounds crazy? Not with the right Indian foods.

## 🧠 Desilifter Protein Math: Example Day

**Goal: 140g Protein (for a 70kg guy)**

| Meal | Food | Protein |
|------|------|---------|
| Breakfast | 3 eggs + 3 whites + roti | 30g |
| Lunch | Chicken breast + rice + dal | 40g |
| Snack | Whey shake + roasted chana | 25g |
| Dinner | Paneer bhurji + roti + dahi | 35g |
| **Total** | — | **130–140g** |

## Things to Avoid, Bhai

- **Too much ghee/oil**: Paneer is great, but deep-fried paneer? Not it.
- **Only carbs**: Chawal + aloo = tasty but not muscle-friendly
- **Skipping protein at breakfast**: Don’t start the day with just chai and toast, bro
