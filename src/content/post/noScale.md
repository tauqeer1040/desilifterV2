## Bhai, You Don’t Need a Food Scale to Get Ripped

Tracking your food like a scientist can get you jacked—but it can also drive you insane.

*Bigger Leaner Stronger* teaches us to manage calories and macros with precision. But as desilifters, we’re eating home-cooked food, not packaged stuff with barcodes.

So how do we track macros without weighing every bite? **Desi hacks, bro.**

## 🎯 BLS Macro Targets (Quick Recap)

Let’s say you weigh **70 kg** and want to lose fat or gain lean muscle.

**Goal macros (per day)**:
- **Protein**: 140g (2g per kg)
- **Fat**: ~60–70g
- **Carbs**: Adjust to hit calorie target (based on bulking or cutting)

## ✋ Macro Tracking for Desilifters: No App, No Stress

### 🫓 Roti Rule of Thumb
- 1 medium roti = ~100 kcal  
- 2g protein, 20g carbs, 2g fat

### 🍚 Rice? Cup It.
- 1 katori (medium bowl) cooked rice = ~150–170 kcal  
- ~30–35g carbs, 3g protein

### 🍛 Dal / Rajma / Chana
- 1 ladle = ~8–10g protein (depends on dal)  
- Also adds fiber and some fat

### 🧀 Paneer
- 100g = ~20g protein, 20g fat  
- Use a deck-of-cards sized piece as your guide

### 🍳 Eggs & Anda Whites
- 1 whole = 6g protein  
- 1 white = 3g, almost no fat

### 🥄 Ghee & Oil
- 1 teaspoon = ~5g fat = 45 kcal  
- Use sparingly, bhai

## 📱 Optional Desi Macro Tracker (No Apps Needed)

| Meal Time | Food | Macro Focus |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Breakfast | Eggs, oats, roti | Protein + carbs |
| Lunch | Dal, rice, sabzi, curd | Protein + carbs + fat |
| Snack | Whey, nuts, roasted chana | Protein + fat |
| Dinner | Paneer/tofu/chicken + roti + dahi | Protein-heavy |
| **Before Bed** | Doodh or Greek yogurt | Slow protein |

You can easily hit 130–150g protein just by **prioritizing protein at every meal**. No weighing. No overthinking.

## 🧠 Desilifter Mindset: "Eyeball, Adjust, Repeat"

> “You don’t need perfect tracking. You need consistent effort.” — *Mike Matthews*

Use your eyes, your gut, and a few basic numbers. After a week, check progress:

- Weight going up too fast? Cut 200 kcal.
- Weight not moving at all? Add 200 kcal.
- Energy dipping? Maybe carbs too low.

## Final Words from a Bhai Who’s Been There

Tracking doesn’t have to feel like jail. Once you get the hang of **visual macros**, it’s just second nature.

> “Macros matter—but so does sanity.” — *Desilifter Rule #3*

Train hard, eat desi, and don’t let calorie-counting steal your love for food.
