## 📝 The ₹30 Habit That Transformed My Gains

I never thought a simple notebook from the local stationary shop would do more for my strength than any supplement ever could. But **writing things down? Game changer**, bhai.

After reading *Bigger Leaner Stronger*, I took Mike Matthews’ advice seriously:  
> “Track your lifts, your reps, your rest, your food—because what gets measured, gets managed.”

## 💪 What I Tracked (And Why You Should Too)

Here's what went in my journal every session:

- 🏋️‍♂️ **Exercise Name**  
- 🔢 **Sets × Reps × Weight (in kg)**  
- ⏱️ **Rest Time**  
- 🤕 **Notes** – “Felt weak today”, “PR on deadlift!”, “Didn’t sleep well”

Bonus: I also wrote my **daily macros**, even if it was just *“Aloo paratha, 3 eggs, whey shake.”*

## 📈 How It Helped Me Level Up

- **Progressive Overload:** I knew when to add weight  
- **Accountability:** No more skipping leg day (it’s there in ink, bhai!)  
- **Motivation Boost:** Seeing past wins fired me up  
- **Recovery Clues:** I noticed patterns—low energy = poor sleep  

> “You can’t improve what you don’t track.” — *Every serious desilifter ever*

## 🏋️‍♂️ Real Talk: Indian Gyms Are Chaos—Journaling Brings Order

Between loud music, crowded benches, and random aunty walking across your deadlift zone... it's madness. Your journal becomes your **personal playbook**.

I kept mine tucked in my gym bag. Pen it down between sets. Simple.
