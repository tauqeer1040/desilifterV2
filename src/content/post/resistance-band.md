## 🏠 No Gym? No Excuse, Here's your cue to get a resistance band!

Gyms are expensive. Dumbbells are loud. But resistance bands? They fit in your drawer—and your budget.

I picked up a basic ₹500 resistance band set from Amazon, and over the next 30 days, it became my **go-to workout tool**. Spoiler: my shoulders popped, my arms tightened, and I didn’t miss the gym *at all*.

## 🥗 Meals That Helped the Gains
