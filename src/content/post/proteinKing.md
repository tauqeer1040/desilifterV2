 ## Why Protein is King in the BLS Diet

 Michael Matthews says:
 > “To build muscle and lose fat, eat about 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.”

 That means if you’re a **70kg desilifter**, you need around **140g of protein** per day.
 Sounds impossible with desi khaana? **Nahi yaar**—you just need smart swaps and planning.
