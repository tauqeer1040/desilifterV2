## üß† 30 Days. One Diary. Big Changes.

I used to ‚Äúguess‚Äù my progress at the gym. Felt strong = good day. Tired = bad day.  
Then I started **tracking every workout**. Just a cheap diary, a blue pen, and 5 lines per day.

After 30 days, I had **more than PRs**‚ÄîI had patterns, mindset shifts, and a system that worked.

## ‚úçÔ∏è What I Tracked (Spoiler: It‚Äôs Not Just Sets & Reps)

Every day after my workout, I wrote:

- üîÅ Exercises + Sets + Weight  
- ‚ö° Energy level (1‚Äì10)  
- üò¥ Sleep hours  
- üçõ Meals  
- üß† Mindset (1 sentence)

> ‚ÄúFelt weak on squats. Slept only 5 hrs. Ate like a champ though.‚Äù

This one-minute journaling habit gave me more insight than months of lifting without notes.

## üìà What Changed in My Body

- More consistent strength gains  
- Smarter recovery (I stopped training on 4 hrs of sleep)  
- Visible muscle growth because I ate *according to my logs*

No more random bro-science workouts. I was training like a **desilifter**, not just another gym rat.

## üß† What Changed in My Mind

James Clear said:

> *‚ÄúEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.‚Äù*

Each journal entry was a vote for becoming disciplined, sharp, and strong.

I noticed fewer excuses. More ownership. More pride.
