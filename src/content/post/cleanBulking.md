## Clean Bulking in India? Sounds Like a Joke… Until It Works

Let’s be real—when someone says **“bulk,”** your mind probably jumps to **butter chicken and cheat meals**. But clean bulking? With Indian food? It sounded impossible.

So I put the *Bigger Leaner Stronger* blueprint to the test—**desilifter style**.

> “To gain muscle without piling on fat, eat about 10–15% more calories than your maintenance level, with high protein.” — *Mike Matthews*

## 🧮 Step 1: Calculate Your Surplus (Desi Style)

Find your **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** using online calculators.  
Let’s say yours is **2,200 calories/day**. Add **10–15% surplus** =  
**~2,500 calories/day** for clean gains.

Now divide it like this (BLS style):

- **Protein**: 2g per kg (for 70kg = 140g → 560 kcal)  
- **Fat**: ~25% of total = ~70g → 630 kcal  
- **Carbs**: Whatever’s left = ~330g → 1,310 kcal

## 🥗 Step 2: Build Your Indian Clean Bulk Plate

| Food | Role | Tips |
|------|------|------|
| **Paneer** | Protein + Fat | Grill or bhurji, not deep fried |
| **Dals** | Protein + Carbs | Moong, masoor, rajma, chana |
| **Rice + Roti** | Carbs | Prefer brown rice, multigrain roti |
| **Tofu** | Lean Protein | Toss with veggies, great in stir-fries |
| **Nuts & Ghee (small amounts)** | Healthy Fat | Use to hit fat macros, not overload |
| **Whey Protein** | Supplement | Use post-workout or as filler |
| **Banana, Oats, Makhana** | Clean carbs | Great for snacks or breakfast |

## 🍟 What I Didn’t Eat

- **No daily cheat meals**  
- **No sugary chai 3x a day**  
- **No overcooked greasy sabzi with 5 tablespoons oil**

Clean bulking doesn’t mean **boring**—it means **strategic**.

## Lessons from the Bulk

- Desi food **can be clean**, if you measure and plan  
- Paneer is your best friend—but don’t go full ghee overload  
- Whey helps bridge gaps, but real food matters more  
- BLS-style bulking isn’t about getting huge fast—it’s about **growing lean**
