## Desilifter Workout Plan: BLS Split Tailored for India

If you're a desi lifter trying to follow the *Bigger Leaner Stronger* (BLS) program by Michael Matthews, but feel lost in the sea of Western-style routines and diets, you're not alone. Indian gyms, schedules, and body types demand a different approach.

This blog breaks down a **weekly BLS split**, adjusted for:

- Indian gym conditions (non-AC, limited equipment, crowded spaces)  
- Metric units (all weights in kg)  
- Realistic weekly schedules for working professionals  

## What is the BLS Workout Split?

The original BLS plan recommends a 5-day workout split focusing on heavy compound lifts and progressive overload:

- **Day 1** – Chest & Triceps  
- **Day 2** – Back & Biceps  
- **Day 3** – Shoulders  
- **Day 4** – Legs  
- **Day 5** – Arms & Core  

Each session focuses on **3–4 heavy lifts** done for **3–5 sets of 4–6 reps**, followed by optional isolation work.

## Desilifter-Friendly Adjustments

Most Indian gyms aren't like the ones you see on YouTube. Here's how we adapt:

- **Limited Equipment?** Focus on dumbbells, barbells, and machines—skip fancy accessories.
- **Too Crowded?** Shift workouts to early morning (6–7 AM) or late evening (9–10 PM).
- **Too Hot?** Keep rest between sets shorter, stay hydrated (ORS + water), and wear breathable cotton.

## Sample Weekly Split (India-Ready)

| Day       | Focus              | Key Lifts (in kg) Example                |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | Chest + Triceps    | Bench Press, Incline DB Press, Dips      |
| Tuesday   | Back + Biceps      | Deadlift, Pull-Ups, Barbell Row          |
| Wednesday | Shoulders          | Overhead Press, Lateral Raise, Shrugs    |
| Thursday  | Legs               | Squats, Leg Press, Calf Raises           |
| Friday    | Arms + Core        | Barbell Curl, Skull Crushers, Planks     |
| Saturday  | Optional Cardio    | Incline Walk, Light Jog, or Sports       |
| Sunday    | Rest               | Sleep, foam rolling, active recovery     |

## Tips for Desilifters

- **Track Your Progress in Kg**: Use a small notebook or Google Sheets to log your reps and weights.  
- **Don’t Skip Compound Lifts**: Prioritize Squats, Deadlifts, Bench, and Overhead Press.  
- **Deload Every 6–8 Weeks**: Take 4–5 days of lighter weights or full rest to recover.  
- **Don’t Chase the Pump—Chase the Progression**: Increase weight or reps weekly.

## Conclusion

A BLS workout plan works beautifully for Indian lifters—if customized smartly. Whether you're training in a big city gym in Mumbai or a small-town setup in Bihar, **Desilifter-style training** is all about adapting the science to your environment.

Lift heavy, stay consistent, and log every set. Jai fitness!
