## 🌀 Gut Feeling: Why Your Stomach Might Be Sabotaging Your Gains

Every time I felt bloated after rajma chawal, I blamed the food. Turns out, the real issue was **how** I was eating—not what.

After reading *Ikigai*, I tried just one principle consistently for a week. The result? No more post-lunch crashes. No more acid reflux.

## 🧘‍♂️ The Rule: “Eat Slowly, Live Fully”

In the Okinawan villages, meals are almost like meditation:

- No phone scrolling  
- Small bowls and portions  
- Chew each bite 20–30 times  
- Focus only on the food

That’s it. No secret spice. No expensive superfood. Just **slowing down**.

## 🥣 What I Changed in My Desi Routine

### Old Me:
- Shoveling down parathas while checking Instagram  
- Finishing meals in 7–8 minutes  
- Feeling sleepy and bloated immediately after

### New Me:
- Eating in silence or talking with family  
- Chewing thoroughly (even daal!)  
- Finishing meals in 20 minutes  
- Feeling calm, not comatose, post-lunch

## 🍛 Meals I Ate That Worked

- **Breakfast:** Poha with peanuts, lemon water  
- **Lunch:** 1 bajra roti, palak paneer, curd  
- **Snack:** Roasted chana + papaya  
- **Dinner:** Idli with sambhar, haldi milk before bed

No skipping meals, no overeating. Just mindful eating, Ikigai-style.

## 🚽 TMI? Maybe. But It’s Real.

Let’s be honest: digestion is the base of everything. If your gut is messed up:

- Workouts feel heavy  
- Sleep is broken  
- Mind stays irritated

Fix your gut = fix your life. *Ikigai* got that right.
