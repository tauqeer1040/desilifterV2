## Why Every Desilifter Needs a Workout Journal

Michael Matthews says,  
> “If you’re not tracking your workouts, you’re just guessing.” — *Mike Matthews, BLS*

Aap ka gym session tabhi impactful hota hai jab aap **har set**, **har rep**, aur **har kg** ko note karte ho. Ye **data** aapko batata hai ki aap improve kar rahe ho ya stuck.

### Benefits of Journaling

1. **Progressive Overload**: Easily see when to add **2.5–5 kg** on bar.  
2. **Consistency**: Din kiska workout miss hua? Journal bata dega.  
3. **Motivation**: Jab weight record aage badhta hai, wo “desi jeet” ka moment hota hai.

## Setting Up Your Desilifter Journal

### 1. Choose Your Format

- **Notebook**: Classic, gym-proof (no battery drain!).  
- **Google Sheets**: Access anywhere, share with buddies.  
- **Fitness App**: Ensure it lets you enter weights in **kg** and custom exercises.

### 2. Core Columns to Include

| Column         | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Date (DD/MM)   | “07/05”                                  |
| Exercise       | “Bench Press” (Hindi note: *Bench Press – seena*) |
| Sets × Reps    | “4×6”                                       |
| Weight (kg)    | “60”                                        |
| RPE            | Rate of Perceived Exertion, scale 1–10.     |
| Notes          | “Felt easy, +2 kg next week”               |

*Tip*: Add a “Mood” column—sometimes *“energy”* and *“neend*” (sleep) affect performance.

## How to Use It for Desi Gains

1. **Pre-Workout**: Note your sleep (neet) and hydration (paani).  
2. **During Workout**: Log immediately—no guessing later.  
3. **Post-Workout**: Write one “Taali bajaao” moment (big win) and one “Sudhaar” point (what to improve).

## Weekly Review: Your Desilifter Checkpoint

Every Sunday, spend **10–15 mins** reviewing:

- Which lifts added kg consistently?  
- Did you hit all sets and reps?  
- Any recurring issues (joint pain, low energy)?  

Create simple charts in Google Sheets (kg vs week) to visualize gains over time.

## Conclusion

A strong body starts with a strong journal. As a **desilifter**, your notebook or sheet is your sabse bada gym partner. Track every rep, celebrate every kilo, and watch yourself transform.
