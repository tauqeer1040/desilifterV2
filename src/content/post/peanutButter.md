## Why Make Peanut Butter at Home?

Store-bought peanut butter can cost ₹300–₹500 a jar. That’s a **lot** when you’re on a student or gym bro budget. But guess what?

**Raw peanuts = ₹90–₹110 per kg**  
**Homemade peanut butter = 1/3 the cost**  
**Plus:** It’s fresh, natural, and no weird chemicals.

Let’s make it.

## 🥜 Ingredients

- **500g raw peanuts** (get them from your local market or Reliance Smart)
- **1–2 tbsp oil** (optional, groundnut or sunflower oil works)
- **1 tsp salt** (optional)
- **1 tsp jaggery or honey** (optional, for sweet version)

---

## 🔥 Equipment

- A **mixer grinder** (the dry/wet jar combo is perfect)
- A spoon and container (to store your gains)

---

## 🧑‍🍳 Step-by-Step Recipe

### 1. **Roast the Peanuts**
- Roast peanuts in a pan on medium heat for 8–10 minutes  
- Stir continuously until they smell nutty and turn golden  
- Let them cool, then **remove the skins** by rubbing between your palms

> 🔥 Lazy hack: Buy already roasted, skinless peanuts from the store

---

### 2. **Grind in Batches**
- Add peanuts to your dry grinder jar (don’t overload!)
- First it becomes powder, then a thick paste  
- Keep grinding and scraping the sides

> 💡 Be patient—oil will release, and it’ll get creamy

---

### 3. **Add Extras (Optional)**
- Want creamy texture? Add **1–2 tbsp oil**
- Want sweet? Add **jaggery powder or honey**
- Want salty? Add **a pinch of salt**

Grind again until smooth or chunky—**your choice!**

---

### 4. **Store It Right**
- Scoop into a **glass or plastic jar**  
- Keep it in the fridge—it stays fresh for 3–4 weeks  
- Stir before use (natural oils separate)
