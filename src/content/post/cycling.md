## 🚴‍♂️ The Cycle That Fixed My Fitness Routine

One day, I dusted off my old Hero cycle.

No Lycra. No fancy helmet. Just a t-shirt, shorts, and **a need to breathe better**.

That 20-minute ride became the **turning point** in my training and mindset.

## ☀️ Why Cycling Works for Desilifters

India’s roads are *chaotic*, but your neighborhood galli or local park loop is **all you need**.

Here’s what cycling did for me:

- 🔥 Burned fat *without* crushing my joints  
- 🧠 Gave me clarity, focus, and calm (better than chai, bro)  
- 💪 Boosted my legs for squats and deadlifts  
- 🌳 Let me enjoy morning sun and fresh air — vitamin D, free of cost!

## 🕖 My 25-Minute Desi Cycle Ritual

- **6:30 AM** – Wake up, quick glass of water  
- **6:45 AM** – On the road with my cycle  
- **25 minutes** – Steady pace, no rush  
- **7:15 AM** – Back, stretch, light breakfast (eggs + toast + chai)

## 🥗 Fueling My Ride

Cycling burns calories fast — so keep it simple:

- Pre-ride: 1 banana or a handful of soaked almonds  
- Post-ride: 2 boiled eggs + roti or daliya  
- Later: Whey shake with milk + 1 fruit  

Don’t ride on an empty stomach — you’ll bonk harder than Delhi traffic at 6PM.

## 🧠 Journal This, Bhai

> “Cycle ride felt peaceful. Body was stiff at first but loosened up. Felt happy by the end. Energy better than coffee. Definitely repeating.”

## Final Thought: Wheels Over Worries

You don’t need Zwift or a ₹90,000 cycle.

You need:

✅ A decent bike  
✅ 20 minutes  
✅ The will to start

Cycling isn’t just cardio. It’s therapy for the **mind and muscles**.

So dust off that old bike.  
Pedal like a desilifter.  
And watch your day get lighter — and your body too.
