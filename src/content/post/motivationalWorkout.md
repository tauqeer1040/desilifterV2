## Train Like a Desilifter: Power of BLS and Arnold's Discipline

In Indian gyms, discipline and jugaad go hand in hand. You may not have fancy equipment, but you have grit. That’s all you need—plus a solid plan. 

This post brings together the **Bigger Leaner Stronger (BLS)** training framework and the mindset of a legend: **Arnold Schwarzenegger**.

## "The worst thing I can be is the same as everybody else." – Arnold

Arnold didn’t become Mr. Olympia by doing average workouts—and neither will you. The BLS method pushes you to **lift heavy**, **track progress**, and **beat your last week’s self**, kilo by kilo.

For the **desilifter**, this means:

- Squatting even when there's no squat rack  
- Deadlifting while people stare  
- Tracking every kg lifted, even when others laugh

## Weekly Routine: Arnold’s Grit + BLS Simplicity

This plan combines Arnold’s volume philosophy with the strength-focus of BLS.

### Desilifter Hybrid Split (Push-Pull-Legs Variation)

| Day       | Focus        | Main Lifts (BLS style)                  | Volume Tip (Arnold-style)       |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Monday    | Push         | Bench Press, Overhead Press             | Add 2 sets of high-rep flys      |
| Tuesday   | Pull         | Deadlifts, Barbell Rows                 | Add barbell shrugs, 3×15         |
| Wednesday | Legs         | Squats, Romanian Deadlifts              | Finish with lunges, 3×12         |
| Thursday  | Rest/Cardio  | Incline walk, 20 mins                   | Use this for recovery & mobility |
| Friday    | Chest & Arms | Incline Bench, Barbell Curls            | Add preacher curls, 3×15         |
| Saturday  | Shoulders    | Arnold Press, Lateral Raises            | Try 1 burnout set at the end     |

## Quote from Mike Matthews:

> “Getting bigger and stronger isn’t about doing more, it’s about doing the right things consistently.” — *Michael Matthews, BLS*

For Indian lifters, that means:

- **No ego lifting**  
- **Form first, then progression**  
- **Stick to your logbook—not Instagram trends**

---

## Desilifter Gym Rules

- **Log everything in kg**: Notebooks > Apps (when your gym has no signal)
- **Avoid timepass sets**: 4–6 reps means *intensity*, not “thoda sa kar liya”
- **Train when others rest**: 6 AM workouts beat rush-hour bro talk

---

## Conclusion

Desilifters don’t need imported machines or AC gyms. They need **clarity, commitment, and compound lifts**. Combine **Arnold's mindset** with **BLS precision** and you’ll build not just muscle—but discipline.

> "You have to remember something: Everybody pities the weak; jealousy you have to earn." – *Arnold Schwarzenegger*

So earn it. Lift like a desilifter. Train like a legend.
