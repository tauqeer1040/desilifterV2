## ðŸŒ… Morning Sunlight: The Desi Wake-Up Call

### India-Friendly Implementation
- **City dwellers:** Stand near open window for 10-15 mins
- **Best time:** Within 30-60 mins of waking
- **No balcony?** Walk while drinking your morning lemon water
- **Polluted areas:** Don't wear sunglasses to maximize light intake

## â˜• The Caffeine Reset (Chai Lovers Rejoice)

### The Problem With Typical Indian Caffeine Habits
- Morning chai immediately after waking
- Multiple chai/coffee throughout day

2. **Pair caffeine with L-theanine alternatives**:
   - Tulsi tea (natural adaptogen)
   - Green tea (contains some L-theanine)
3. **Cutoff time:** No caffeine after 2PM
4. **Afternoon alternative:** Ashwagandha milk or sattu drink
