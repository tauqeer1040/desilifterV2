## Why a 5-Day Split Is the Desilifter’s Secret Weapon

When Mike Matthews says **“train each muscle group once per week with maximum intensity,”** you listen. But doing a generic 5-day routine in a crowded Mumbai gym? Tough.

That’s why I built the **Desi 5-Day Split**: heavy compound lifts, smart rest days, and perfect for taming India’s gym chaos.

## How to Make It Work in Any Indian Gym

1. **No Rack?** Swap barbell squats for goblet squats with a 20–30kg dumbbell.  
2. **Limited Plates?** Focus on perfect form and slower negatives.  
3. **Crowded?** Superset smaller lifts (curls + tricep dips) to save time.

## Tracking Your Progress, Desilifter-Style

- Use a **small notebook**: record day, lift, sets, reps, weight in kg.  
- **Every week**, aim to add **2.5–5kg** on compound lifts.  
- **Deload** after 6–8 weeks: drop weight by 40% for one week to recover.
