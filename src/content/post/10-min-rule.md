## 😩 “Bas Aaj Mood Nahin Hai...” Sound Familiar?

How many times have you stood in your room, gym bag in hand, and thought:

> “Aaj skip kar lete hain... kal se pakka.”

I used to do that at least 2–3 times a week.

But then I discovered a **simple mental hack** from the *David Goggins* playbook:

## ⏱ The 10-Minute Rule

Here’s how it works:

Whenever your brain says **“Skip it”**,  
you say: **“I’ll just do 10 minutes.”**

That’s it.

- 10 minutes of walking
- 10 minutes of pushups
- 10 minutes of stretching or foam rolling
- 10 minutes of **something**

And guess what?  
**Once you start, you rarely stop.**

## 💥 Why It Works (Especially for Desilifters)

We’ve got busy lives:  
Traffic, work, family, heat, shaadis, exams—you name it.

But this rule removes the **all-or-nothing** mindset.

It tells your brain: *“We’re not skipping. We’re just starting.”*

And **starting is everything**.

> “You don’t have to want it. You just have to begin.” — *David Goggins*

## 🧠 Journal Entry: Day I Almost Skipped

> “Didn’t feel like training today. Told myself ‘10 mins only.’ Ended up doing my full pull day. Funny how the body follows once the mind commits.”

## 👊 Real Wins from a Simple Shift

Since I started using this:
- My **consistency improved**
- My **discipline sharpened**
- I stopped saying “kal se”

Because now, I don’t need motivation.  
I just need **10 minutes**.

## 📌 Try This Desilifter Challenge:

- Set a timer for 10 minutes
- Move your body — no rules, no pressure
- If you want to stop after, cool. But 90% of the time, you won’t.

This isn’t about training like a beast.  
It’s about **outsmarting your lazy brain.**

## Final Thought: The First 10 Minutes Are the Hardest. Win Them.

Every desilifter knows—it’s not the reps that are hard.  
It’s lacing up your shoes.

So next time your brain screams *“NO”*, whisper back:

**“Just 10 minutes, bhai.”**

And go prove it wrong.
