## What Are Macros?

Macros = **macronutrients**:  
- **Protein** (for muscle and repair)  
- **Carbs** (for energy)  
- **Fats** (for hormones and flavor 🌶️)

Tracking macros helps you:
- Build muscle 💪
- Lose fat 🔥
- Stop guessing what’s “healthy”

But here’s the issue: Most guides use chicken and quinoa. Let’s talk **dal, roti, chawal**, and other Indian favorites—**with portion sizes you can actually visualize**.
