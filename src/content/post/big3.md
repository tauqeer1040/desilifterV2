## The Desilifter’s Big 3: Squat, Deadlift & Bench Press

In *Bigger Leaner Stronger*, Michael Matthews emphasizes the "Big 3" compound lifts as the foundation of strength and muscle gain. But for desi lifters in India, crowded gyms and limited equipment can make these lifts a bit tricky.

This post helps you master these lifts—**safely, effectively, and using kg**—the **Desilifter way**.

---

## 1. Squat (Barbell Back Squat)

**Target Muscles**: Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Core

### Desilifter Tips:
- **Start with bodyweight** if your gym has no squat rack.
- Use a **multipurpose barbell** and ask a gym buddy for spotting.
- If you train at home, use **goblet squats** with a dumbbell (20–30kg).

### Common Mistakes:
- Knees caving in – remind yourself: *“ghutne bahar”*
- Not hitting depth – thighs should be **parallel to floor or deeper**

## 2. Deadlift

**Target Muscles**: Hamstrings, Glutes, Back, Traps, Core

### Desilifter Tips:
- Use **iron plates** if bumper plates aren't available (just control the drop).
- If your gym doesn't allow deadlifts, do **Romanian Deadlifts with dumbbells**.

### Setup Reminder:
- Keep the bar close—**“shins ko chhoo rahi ho”**
- Hips between your knees and shoulders—don’t squat the deadlift!

---

## 3. Bench Press

**Target Muscles**: Chest, Triceps, Shoulders

### Desilifter Tips:
- Ensure the bench is stable (some cheap benches in Indian gyms wobble).
- Use **a spotter** or start with **dumbbells** for safety.

### Form Cues:
- Arch your back slightly—**“seena bahar, kandhe neeche”**
- Grip width: forearms vertical when the bar touches your chest

## How to Program These Lifts

Use the **4–6 rep range** as BLS recommends.

| Lift        | Sets | Reps | Rest Time |
|-------------|------|------|-----------|
| Squat       | 3–5  | 4–6  | 2–3 mins  |
| Deadlift    | 3–4  | 4–6  | 2–3 mins  |
| Bench Press | 3–5  | 4–6  | 2–3 mins  |

Progressive overload is key: aim to increase weight by **2.5–5 kg** every 1–2 weeks.

## Conclusion

These 3 lifts are your ticket to real strength and size—Desilifter style. Don’t get distracted by fancy Instagram workouts. Stick to the basics, master your form, and train smart with what your Indian gym offers.

**Har rep count karta hai. Har kg ka hisaab rakho.**
