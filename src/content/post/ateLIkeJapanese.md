## 🍵 What Happens When a Desi Guy Tries the Ikigai Diet?

You’ve heard of keto, intermittent fasting, and high-protein diets—but what about eating like the long-living villagers of Okinawa, Japan?

After reading *Ikigai*, I tried their way of eating for 7 days. The twist? I adapted it to our Indian kitchens. Spoiler: I felt **lighter, calmer, and more energetic**.

## 🧠 What Is the Ikigai Diet?

The elders of Okinawa live well into their 90s and 100s. Their diet is simple:

- Plant-based and seasonal
- Low in calories but high in nutrients
- Eaten slowly and mindfully
- Stopping at 80% full (called *Hara Hachi Bu*)

It’s not a “diet” as we know it—it’s a way of living.

## 🍛 How I Made It Work Desi Style

Here’s what I ate, Indian edition:

- 🥗 **Lunch:** Mix veg sabzi with olive oil, 1 roti (multigrain), 1 small bowl of brown rice  
- 🍠 **Snacks:** Roasted peanuts, fruit, green tea  
- 🥣 **Dinner:** Moong dal khichdi, sautéed spinach, papaya  
- 🍵 **Drinks:** Warm water, haldi milk at night, green tea twice a day  

I followed the 80% full rule, chewed slow, and avoided distractions. No Netflix during dinner, bro.

## ⚡ What Changed After 7 Days?

- **Energy:** I didn’t feel bloated or sluggish  
- **Digestion:** No acidity or heaviness post meals  
- **Sleep:** Deeper, more restful sleep  
- **Mind:** I felt calmer, even while stuck in traffic  

Turns out, eating light also makes your brain feel light.

## 🇮🇳 Why Desis Need This Now More Than Ever

Let’s be real—we’ve moved far from our roots:

- Processed snacks every evening  
- Eating till we’re stuffed at weddings  
- Skipping veggies for paneer tikka every other day

But *Ikigai* teaches us: **Eat less, eat natural, eat slowly.**

## 🕊️ 3 Simple Rules for Desi Ikigai Nutrition

1. **Eat seasonal and local** – Sabzi mandi over supermarket  
2. **Follow Hara Hachi Bu** – Stop before you're totally full  
3. **Add color to your plate** – Greens, oranges, purples = more antioxidants

## Final Thoughts: Your Kitchen Might Already Be the Key to Longevity

No need for fancy protein powders or imported avocados. Your nani’s kitchen already had the answer—**dal, roti, sabzi**, made with love, eaten with peace.
